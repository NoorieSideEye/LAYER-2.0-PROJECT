The goal of the problem statement was to address two issues: the fact that a lot of food is wasted every day and that some people go without food. The second issue was that, despite 66% of the population working in agriculture, Nepal's output was insufficient for its population. We have imagined an application that covers both areas in order to do that. 

Our proposed solution is “FoodSave”, which is robust and addresses the issues of both parties involved. We have thoroughly considered the problem statement and have formulated an appropriate answer to that likewise. This app is based on the Ethereum-based blockchain architecture implemented using a simple user friendly frontend.
